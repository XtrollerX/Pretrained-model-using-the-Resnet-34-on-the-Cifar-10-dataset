# Pretrained-model-using-the-Resnet-34-on-the-Cifar-10-dataset
Utilising transfer learning, I was able to score a 95% validation accuracy  on the Cifar-10 dataset. I was able to generate this accuracy without freezing the CNN layers(prevent-gradient-optimizations) and changing the FCL(fully-connected-layers) to optimize the model for my current dataset. I utilised what I know from the previous repositories "Self-made-Resnet-CNN-model-Cifar-10-dataset".
# What I learned
- Learning how to change the FCL for my data.
- Finding out how to use pre-trained models to help me improve accuracy for my model
